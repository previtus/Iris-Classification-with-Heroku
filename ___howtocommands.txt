Setup was a little bit different from the instructions ....
This now works with python3.

// init the git repo
git clone https://github.com/gaborvecsei/Iris-Classification-with-Heroku.git
cd Iris-Classification-with-Heroku

git init
git add --all
git commit -m "init"

heroku apps:create your-app-name
heroku buildpacks:add https://github.com/heroku-python/conda-buildpack
heroku config:set KERAS_BACKEND=theano

git push heroku master


## Changes?

# buildpacks was different, previous one resulted in errors with pip
# made changes to requirments.txt, adding keras
# rewriting for python3 (as that was default with my heroku setup), commented the whole plotPrediction(...)


## Useful commands ?

# heroku logs
# to check when there are errors on heroku server side

# heroku run bash
# to see folder structure on server, also to try python
